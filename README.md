# Bootstrap Book
Learn how to Write a Compiler in 2000 Lines of Code

### λ☶

This book explains the code of the λ☶ compiler to anyone who is interested in compiler architecture or functional language compilers.
The code is roughly 2000 LOC in length, but it is very terse, so the explanation takes a while.
The generated code is in the format of GNU Assembly for legibility.
Binary targets are just as easy to write, but harder to read.
